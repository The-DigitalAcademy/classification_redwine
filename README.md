## Table of contents 

## General info 

### Red wine quality classifier 

A red wine classification model that uses a random forest classifier to classify wine based of pH ,alcohol , acidity etc.

### Technologies used 

Python

Flask (Dashboard)

Sklearn (Machine Learning)

SAS (For analysis)

### Features 

Uses are able to enter input of the different fields of alchol , pH etc. of their wine and get back the quality of the wine with 
3-4 being bad , 5-6 being medium and 7-8 being good

### Fields 

1. fixed acidity 

2. volatile acidity

3. citric acid

4. residual sugar 

5. chlorides 

6. free sulfur dioxide 

7. total sulfur dioxide 

8. Density

9. Sulphates

10. Alcohol

#### Target

Quality
